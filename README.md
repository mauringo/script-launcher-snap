# Snap to autostart bluetooth at boot



## Why?
Using Ubuntu Core devices it is not always possible to easily start commends at startup

## Usage
The script launched is in the following folder:  

    /var/snap/script-launcher/common
    

It is possible to prevent the script to be autostarted removing the file:
   
    /var/snap/script-launcher/common/autostarton
